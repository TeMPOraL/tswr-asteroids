Some design notes to help finalize the game.


* Roadmap / plan

** Schedule
*** <2017-01-27 pią>--<2017-01-29 nie>

**** DOING Try playing with various wrap-around settings
     - [X] no wrap-around for bullets
     - [ ] no wrap-around for ships (dies on hitting border)

**** TODO Improve collision detection efficiency
     At least eliminate that stupid N^2 thingy.

**** DONE Death == reset playing area
     CLOSED: [2017-01-27 pią 01:33]
     Don't forget to reset scores

*** <2017-01-30 pon>--<2017-02-05 nie>

**** TODO Add lives

**** TODO 1-up powerup

**** TODO Add graphics for powerups that would let you distinguish between them

**** TODO All asteroids killed = spawn new (more)
     Add a ramping-up difficulty

**** TODO Implement laser

** Task staging ground
   I.e. unscheduled yet.

*** TODO Find some sounds and add them
    - [ ] bullet shot
    - [ ] triple shot
    - [ ] asteroid hit
    - [ ] powerup collected
    - [ ] ship destroyed

*** TODO Try out continuously spawning asteroids instead

*** TODO Think of aesthetics you could use for the game

*** TODO Implement explosive bullets

*** TODO Implement missile launcher

*** TODO Implement shields

*** TODO Implement Hanzo bullets

*** TODO Implement a more complicated movement mechanic
    I.e. thruster mechanic using numpad.

*** TODO Implement a more smooth turning physics
    Try basing turning on rotational acceleration + friction.

*** TODO Try and make a continous collision detection algo
    Or that magic w/ Minkowski algebra. Anyway, something to avoid fast bullets passing through objects.

*** TODO Profile game and improve its efficiency

*** TODO Make a release bundle for Linux and Windows

* Main game
** UI elements
   - lives remaining
   - current score
   - high score
   - current weapon
   - current ship buffs (alternatively: visible on ship)
   - current weapon buffs (alternatively: visible on ship)

** Basic entity categories

*** Player Ship
*** Asteroid
    Splits into smaller when destroyed, several times. Smallest just die.
    Gives points, occassionally drops a powerup.

*** Bullet
    Kills asteroids.

*** Powerup
    Collected when colliding with player ship; decaying with time.

*** (future) some other kind of enemy (maybe an intelligent one)

** Buffs
   ALL BUFFS ARE INDEPENDENT and can be intermixed, though in some cases, a combination may be meaningless.

*** Gun types
    - [X] machine gun - fires bullets
    - [ ] cannon - fires explosive bullets
    - [ ] missile launcher - fires homing missiles that aim for closest target
    - [ ] laser - fires laser beams that can hit all targets along the beam

*** Gun buffs
    Can be equipped simultaneously.
    - [X] triple shot - shoots 3 bullets in spread, like: \|/.
    - [X] bidirectional shot - shoots additional bullet from behind
    - [X] faster fire - halves cooldown
    - [X] faster bullets - bullets move faster (not applicable to laser)
    - [X] big bullets - mutliplies the size of the bullet

*** Bullet types
    - [X] standard - collision = hit
    - [ ] explosive - short range; explode on collision or decay, explosion kills everything in range
    - [ ] fragmentary - on collision, besides destroying the target it splits into number of standard bullet shards somewhat uniformly
    - [ ] Hanzo - like fragmentary, except fragments are fast-moving and launched in a fan, as if they bounced off the target's bounding sphere

*** Bullet buffs
    - [X] longer living bullets - increases (e.g. doubles) the life time of bullets

*** Ship buffs
    - [ ] shield - a shield that can resist one collision with an asteroid
    - [ ] repulsor - pushes asteroids away a bit in a small radius around the ship

** Game rules
   - player starts with N lives
   - ship collides with asteroid => asteroid is destroyed, and:
     - player has shield => player loses shield
     - player has no shield => ship is destroyed, player loses life
   - lives == 0 => game over
   - asteroid is destroyed => player gets points for it
   - asteroids are continuously spawned randomly at the edge of the screen
     - asteroid spawn frequency, starting size and starting speed increases with game time
   - game has no win condition - you fight until you die

** Bugs to fix
*** BUG Collision handling fires multiple time per frame for an object if it collides with several other
    This way, one bullet can destroy a bunch of asteroids at the same time.
    Should not happen by default, IMO. Or at least, not for normal bullets.

    IMO best way would be to mark standard bullets as "dead" in collision handling,
    and reject further collision pairs in which a "dead" bullet shows up.
