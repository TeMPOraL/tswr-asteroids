#+title: Design notes

Some design notes to help finalize the game.

* Main game
** UI elements
   - lives remaining
   - current score
   - high score
   - current weapon
   - current ship buffs (alternatively: visible on ship)
   - current weapon buffs (alternatively: visible on ship)

** Basic entity categories

*** Player Ship
*** Asteroid
    Splits into smaller when destroyed, several times. Smallest just die.
    Gives points, occassionally drops a powerup.

*** Bullet
    Kills asteroids.

*** Powerup
    Collected when colliding with player ship; decaying with time.

*** (future) some other kind of enemy (maybe an intelligent one)

** Buffs
   ALL BUFFS ARE INDEPENDENT and can be intermixed, though in some cases, a combination may be meaningless.

*** Gun types
    - machine gun - fires bullets
    - cannon - fires explosive bullets
    - missile launcher - fires homing missiles that aim for closest target
    - laser - fires laser beams that can hit all targets along the beam

*** Gun buffs
    Can be equipped simultaneously.
    - triple shot - shoots 3 bullets in spread, like: \|/.
    - bidirectional shot - shoots additional bullet from behind
    - faster fire - halves cooldown
    - faster bullets - bullets move faster (not applicable to laser)
    - big bullets - mutliplies the size of the bullet

*** Bullet types
    - standard - collision = hit
    - explosive - short range; explode on collision or decay, explosion kills everything in range
    - fragmentary - on collision, besides destroying the target it splits into number of standard bullet shards somewhat uniformly
    - Hanzo - like fragmentary, except fragments are fast-moving and launched in a fan, as if they bounced off the target's bounding sphere

*** Bullet buffs
    - longer living bullets - increases (e.g. doubles) the life time of bullets

*** Ship buffs
    - shield - a shield that can resist one collision with an asteroid
    - repulsor - pushes asteroids away a bit in a small radius around the ship

** Game rules
   - player starts with N lives
   - ship collides with asteroid => asteroid is destroyed, and:
     - player has shield => player loses shield
     - player has no shield => ship is destroyed, player loses life
   - lives == 0 => game over
   - asteroid is destroyed => player gets points for it
   - asteroids are continuously spawned randomly at the edge of the screen
     - asteroid spawn frequency, starting size and starting speed increases with game time
   - game has no win condition - you fight until you die
