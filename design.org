Some design notes to help finalize the game.

* Roadmap / plan

** Schedule
*** <2017-01-27 pią>--<2017-01-29 nie>

**** DONE Try playing with various wrap-around settings
     CLOSED: [2017-01-29 nie 14:07]
     - [X] no wrap-around for bullets
     - [X] no wrap-around for ships (dies on hitting border)
       I'd say that the only thing we need to add is some detection the entity is a ship and needs to run game-rules code as it dies.

**** DONE Improve collision detection efficiency
     CLOSED: [2017-01-28 sob 21:23]
     At least eliminate that stupid N^2 thingy.

     First, measure max collision system (inner) iterations per game update. Verify if it's in N^2
     range.

     Add an entity-added and entity-removed hooks to #'update-system. In the future, consider
     instead having a system define its own entity sets and matching criteria.

     In collision system, use the hooks to maintain a list of layer -> entities on that layer.

     Replace the other-id loop in collision system w/ loops over entities in appropriate layers.

     Rest of the handling code should be the same.

     (NOTE this will destroy any possibility of dynamicly changing collision layers in-game; making
     it work again will require either an additional layer-modifed function provided by the system,
     or regenerating the lists every update (which is O(N), so not *that* bad, but not good
     either).)

**** DONE Make bullets die immediately if not wrapped-around
     CLOSED: [2017-01-27 pią 22:32]
     That should significantly save on computation

**** DONE Death == reset playing area
     CLOSED: [2017-01-27 pią 01:33]
     Don't forget to reset scores

*** <2017-01-30 pon>--<2017-02-05 nie>

**** DONE Add lives
     CLOSED: [2017-01-29 nie 15:10]
     - [X] need a display of number of lives left - maybe reuse the ship sprite, but draw just an outline
     - [X] need a "respawn" function that doesn't clear the map
     - [X] will probably need to introduce a temporary "respawn shield" that makes the ship invulnerable for a second or two

**** DONE 1-up powerup
     CLOSED: [2017-01-29 nie 15:19]

*** <2017-02-13 pon>--<2017-02-19 nie>
    Didn't do much.

*** <2017-02-20 pon>--<2017-02-26 nie>
    Didn't do much either.

*** <2017-11-13 Mon>--<2017-11-20 Mon>

**** DONE Add main game screen
     CLOSED: [2017-11-14 Tue 21:32]

**** DONE Add pause screen
     CLOSED: [2017-11-14 Tue 21:32]

**** TODO Fix player ship sprite
     Make it look nicer.

**** DONE Add blinking before decay for powerups
     CLOSED: [2017-11-19 Sun 18:18]

**** DONE Add support for negative and random (i.e. either pos or neg) powerups
     CLOSED: [2017-11-19 Sun 20:52]
     Need to be visually different.

**** DONE Add graphics for powerups that would let you distinguish between them
     CLOSED: [2017-11-19 Sun 20:52]
     Maybe something simple / with color. Since we have text capabilities now, we can draw letters instead / in addition of
     of the yellow triangle.

**** TODO Add a health bar for player; try out the Tess version of gameplay
     Also: when shield is active, you can draw it in a different (blue?) color, with words SHIELD, or sth.

**** DONE Add stars in the background
     CLOSED: [2017-11-19 Sun 16:30]

**** CANCELLED(c@/! All asteroids killed = spawn new (more)
     CLOSED: [2017-11-15 Wed 19:02]
     Add a ramping-up difficulty

     I don't even remember what was that supposed to be.

**** CANCELLED Implement laser (maybe reconsider if not out of scope?)
     CLOSED: [2017-02-23 czw 02:47]
     - State "CANCELLED"  from "TODO"       [2017-02-23 czw 02:47] \\
       Declared out of scope for now.

**** CANCELLED(c@/! Add intro banner
     CLOSED: [2017-11-15 Wed 19:03]
     Main Menu is good enough.

** Task staging ground
   I.e. unscheduled yet.

*** TODO consider temporary powerups
    I.e. (some) powerups actually decay after a bunch of seconds, and are also
    displayed in the UI. That would allow for increasing the amount of
    powerups dropped, make the positive one less game-breaking, and negative
    ones less annoying.

*** TODO Implement some negative powerups
    - [ ] losing score
    - [ ] something slowing down the ship or controls?

*** TODO Particle trail behind the ship

*** TODO (consider) Particle-based explosions?

*** TODO (to consider) Asteroid health
    Either implicit, or displayed as small cracks on the object

*** TODO Find some sounds and add them
    - [ ] bullet shot
    - [ ] triple shot
    - [ ] asteroid hit
    - [ ] powerup collected
    - [ ] ship destroyed

*** TODO Think of aesthetics you could use for the game

*** TODO Try out continuously spawning asteroids instead
    Whatever that means. Like, infinite game / no levels?

*** TODO Implement explosive bullets
    New system type: explosion-expander; sole role is increasing collision radius (and sprite
    size). New entity type too, and a new sprite (expanding circle for now, maybe).

    Explosive bullets spawn the explosion entity on death.

*** TODO Implement missile launcher

*** TODO Implement shields

*** TODO Implement Hanzo bullets

*** TODO Implement a more complicated movement mechanic
    I.e. thruster mechanic using numpad.

*** TODO Implement a more smooth turning physics
    Try basing turning on rotational acceleration + friction.

*** TODO Try and make a continous collision detection algo
    Or that magic w/ Minkowski algebra. Anyway, something to avoid fast bullets passing through objects.

*** TODO Profile game and improve its efficiency

*** TODO Make a release bundle for Linux and Windows

* Main game
** UI elements
   - lives remaining
   - current score
   - high score
   - current weapon
   - current ship buffs (alternatively: visible on ship)
   - current weapon buffs (alternatively: visible on ship)

** Basic entity categories

*** Player Ship
*** Asteroid
    Splits into smaller when destroyed, several times. Smallest just die.
    Gives points, occassionally drops a powerup.

*** Bullet
    Kills asteroids.

*** Powerup
    Collected when colliding with player ship; decaying with time.

*** (future) some other kind of enemy (maybe an intelligent one)

** Buffs
   ALL BUFFS ARE INDEPENDENT and can be intermixed, though in some cases, a combination may be meaningless.

*** Gun types
    - [X] machine gun - fires bullets
    - [ ] cannon - fires explosive bullets
    - [ ] missile launcher - fires homing missiles that aim for closest target
    - [ ] laser - fires laser beams that can hit all targets along the beam

*** Gun buffs
    Can be equipped simultaneously.
    - [X] triple shot - shoots 3 bullets in spread, like: \|/.
    - [X] bidirectional shot - shoots additional bullet from behind
    - [X] faster fire - halves cooldown
    - [X] faster bullets - bullets move faster (not applicable to laser)
    - [X] big bullets - mutliplies the size of the bullet

*** Bullet types
    - [X] standard - collision = hit
    - [ ] explosive - short range; explode on collision or decay, explosion kills everything in range
    - [ ] fragmentary - on collision, besides destroying the target it splits into number of standard bullet shards somewhat uniformly
    - [ ] Hanzo - like fragmentary, except fragments are fast-moving and launched in a fan, as if they bounced off the target's bounding sphere

*** Bullet buffs
    - [X] longer living bullets - increases (e.g. doubles) the life time of bullets

*** Ship buffs
    - [ ] shield - a shield that can resist one collision with an asteroid
    - [ ] repulsor - pushes asteroids away a bit in a small radius around the ship

** Game rules
   - player starts with N lives
   - ship collides with asteroid => asteroid is destroyed, and:
     - player has shield => player loses shield
     - player has no shield => ship is destroyed, player loses life
   - lives == 0 => game over
   - asteroid is destroyed => player gets points for it
   - asteroids are continuously spawned randomly at the edge of the screen
     - asteroid spawn frequency, starting size and starting speed increases with game time
   - game has no win condition - you fight until you die

** Bugs to fix
*** BUG Collision handling fires multiple time per frame for an object if it collides with several other
    This way, one bullet can destroy a bunch of asteroids at the same time.
    Should not happen by default, IMO. Or at least, not for normal bullets.

    IMO best way would be to mark standard bullets as "dead" in collision handling,
    and reject further collision pairs in which a "dead" bullet shows up.

*** BUG Sometimes you respawn with asteroids that just start to split
    Theory: if you die in the same frame an asteroid is about to be torn apart,
    child asteroids are spawned *after* all other entities are marked for deletion,
    leading to those children remaining.

    Could fire up additional #'p2de:schedule-all-entities-for-deletion and hope the player
    won't notice one frame of invalid game state, but I would prefer a cleaner solution.

* Playtesting ideas

** Tess
   <2017-01-28 sob>
   - [ ] negatywne bonusy
   - [ ] bonusy pytajniki (nie wiadomo czy pozytywny czy negatywny)
   - [X] zmniejszyć max szybkość statku
   - [ ] lepsze bronie dostępne z kolejnymi poziomami
   - [ ] rozpadanie się asteroid na późniejszym poziomie
   - [ ] miganie powerupów przed decayem
   - [X] tymczasowa osłona po respawnie przy stracie życia
   - [ ] alternatywa: zamiast żyć, pasek energii
     - większa asteroida = większy damage
     - asteroida nie umiera od zderzenia
     - [my idea] może im szybciej tym większy damage?
     - [my idea] also: odbicie się od asteroidy (niesprężyste, ale zawsze) - może być fajna mechanika gry :D
